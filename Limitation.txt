These are my assumptions for doing this project:
1- the number of nodes is nearly less than ex: 10,000,000 because the isse is about the structure of company.
2- It will lunch on one server and any user could use it, but if anyone changes and update the nodes, changes will be seen with others.
   If it supposed to establish in many servers, I should be used the other methods like SQL Server, not file.
3- I am considered that rate of changes are much less than reading. So time complexity for updating is O(n) because after any changes 
   the main file should overwrite and time complexity for reading is O(1).
4- When we read any node, system will calculate the level of the given node. If our tree approximately is balanced, Time complexity for 
   calculating level will be O(log(n)).
5- You could not set Root as the child of any node.
6- You could not set a specific node as a  child of itself.



I have 2 Api 
1-  Get : https://localhost:44342/CompanyStructure/GetNode/2
2- Patch: https://localhost:44342/CompanyStructure/MoveNode/3/2
    in this api : 3 should set as child of 2
